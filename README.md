# Berry Selector
During an EPFL project in product design, we had to implement on a robotic arm a camera and software capable of detecting and selecting berries : ripe/unripe, red/black

# TODO
- Make better parameters of filters
- If possible, add small explicative text on the UI
- Add 3 variables with the rate of white, black and red
- Add a string variable with the biggest rate color ('white', 'black', 'red')
